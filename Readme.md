Solution to Question 4:

Recall the definition of the Frobenius norm
$$
||A||_F = \sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(A^\top A)}
$$
Hence, by linearality of trace, we get
$$
\operatorname{tr}(\mathcal{F}^\top \mathcal{F} - I) = \operatorname{tr}(\mathcal{F}^\top \mathcal{F}) - \operatorname{tr}(I) = \operatorname{tr}(\mathcal{F}^\top \mathcal{F}) - 2 = ||\mathcal{F}||_F^2 - 2
$$
